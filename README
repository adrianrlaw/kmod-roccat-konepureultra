kmod-roccat-konepureultra - A Driver for the Roccat Kone Pure Ultra

	This project intends to bring support for
	Roccat's newer Kone Pure to Linux.

	Currently, the driver is in it's early stages,
	and I still need to find any quirks that I
	should worry about.

Building

	A simple "$ make" and "# make install" should
	compile and install the kernel module for your
	currently running kernel.

Contribution

	Please read the Linux Kernel Coding Style.

		https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html

	Eventually, when this driver is guaranteed to
	work, I would want to submit this code into the
	upstream kernel release.
